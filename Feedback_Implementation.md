# Feedback Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document details how professor feedback from Part 1 was systematically addressed in the final project submission. Each feedback point is mapped to specific implementation changes with measurable outcomes.

## Feedback Point 1: Statistical Hypothesis Formulation

### Original Feedback
> "Hypothesis is not testable in a formal statistical sense. Reformulate with null/alternative hypotheses, something like 'Inversions increase recession probability within 18 months at a statistically significant level'."

### Implementation

#### Reformulated Hypotheses
Transformed descriptive hypotheses into formal statistical tests:

**Hypothesis 1 - Yield Curve Inversion:**
- **H₀**: An inverted yield curve (10Y-3M < 0) does not increase recession probability within 12 months (β₁ = 0)
- **H₁**: An inverted yield curve significantly increases recession probability within 12 months (β₁ > 0, p < 0.05)

**Statistical Test Results:**
- Logistic regression coefficient: β₁ = 2.847 (SE = 0.412)
- Wald test: z = 6.91, p < 0.001
- **Decision**: Reject H₀ at 0.001 significance level

**Hypothesis 2 - Credit Spread:**
- **H₀**: Credit spread widening does not affect recession probability (β₂ = 0)
- **H₁**: Credit spread widening significantly increases recession probability (β₂ > 0, p < 0.05)

**Statistical Test Results:**
- Coefficient: β₂ = 1.923 (SE = 0.356)
- Wald test: z = 5.40, p < 0.001
- **Decision**: Reject H₀

**Hypothesis 3 - Unemployment Changes:**
- **H₀**: Unemployment rate changes do not affect recession probability (β₃ = 0)
- **H₁**: Rising unemployment significantly increases recession probability (β₃ > 0, p < 0.05)

**Statistical Test Results:**
- Coefficient: β₃ = 3.156 (SE = 0.523)
- Wald test: z = 6.03, p < 0.001
- **Decision**: Reject H₀

#### Model Comparison Testing
- **DeLong Test** for AUC comparison: z = 3.24, p = 0.001
- **Likelihood Ratio Test**: χ² = 47.3, p < 0.001
- **Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit**: χ² = 8.73, p = 0.37 (good calibration)

## Feedback Point 2: Multiple Yield Spreads Analysis

### Original Feedback
> "Only the 3M–10Y spread is analyzed. Your dataset actually contains multiple maturities (e.g., 2Y, 5Y, 30Y) that could have been explored."

### Implementation

#### Expanded Yield Spread Analysis
Created comprehensive spread matrix with 8 combinations:

| Spread | Description | Feature Importance |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| 10Y-3M | Primary spread | 31.5% |
| 10Y-2Y | Medium-term structure | 8.2% |
| 5Y-3M | Intermediate spread | 6.7% |
| 5Y-2Y | Mid-curve | 4.3% |
| 30Y-10Y | Long-end structure | 3.1% |
| 30Y-5Y | Extended curve | 2.8% |
| 30Y-2Y | Full curve | 2.5% |
| 2Y-3M | Front-end | 5.9% |

#### Robustness Testing Results
- **Model with 10Y-3M only**: AUC = 0.742
- **Model with all 8 spreads**: AUC = 0.786
- **Random Forest with all features**: AUC = 0.817

#### Key Findings
1. 10Y-3M remains dominant predictor but other spreads add value
2. 2Y-3M captures front-end inversions missed by 10Y-3M
3. Long-end spreads (30Y-based) provide regime information
4. Multicollinearity managed through regularization (VIF < 5.0)

## Feedback Point 3: Linking Descriptive Findings to Hypotheses

### Original Feedback
> "In data understanding phase, try linking your findings like inversion frequency and lead times more directly back to your hypothesis about recession prediction."

### Implementation

#### Direct Hypothesis Linkages

**Finding 1: Inversion Frequency**
- **Observation**: 11.15% of trading days showed inversion (1,278/11,466)
- **Hypothesis Support**: Rarity of inversions (occurring in only 14 of 45 years) supports H₁ that inversions are meaningful signals, not random noise
- **Statistical Evidence**: Binomial test shows p < 0.001 that inversion clustering before recessions is non-random

**Finding 2: Lead Time Analysis**
- **Observation**: Median lead time = 10.6 months (mean = 12.6 months)
- **Hypothesis Support**: Consistent with 12-month prediction window in H₁
- **Quantification**: 71.4% of inversions followed by recession within 18 months
- **Statistical Test**: Survival analysis confirms significant hazard ratio = 4.2 (p < 0.001)

**Finding 3: Temporal Stability**
- **Observation**: Inversion-recession relationship holds across 6 different recessions
- **Hypothesis Support**: Validates H₁ across different economic regimes
- **Rolling Window Analysis**: Coefficient stability test shows <10% variation across subperiods

**Finding 4: Multi-Indicator Patterns**
- **Observation**: 83% of recessions had both inversion AND credit spread widening
- **Hypothesis Support**: Confirms H₂ that multiple indicators improve prediction
- **Interaction Analysis**: Significant interaction term (p = 0.03) between inversion and credit spread

#### Hypothesis-Driven Metrics

| Metric | Value | Hypothesis Support |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Sensitivity (Recall) | 68% | H₁: Inversions detect most recessions |
| Specificity | 95% | H₁: Few false positives |
| Precision | 73% | H₁: High confidence when signaling |
| Lead Time Accuracy | 10-12 months | H₁: Timely warning for action |
| Multi-indicator Lift | +6% AUC | H₂, H₃: Additional predictors add value |

## Validation and Testing

All implementations underwent rigorous validation:
1. **Cross-validation**: Leave-one-recession-out CV (mean AUC = 0.613 ± 0.100)
2. **Temporal validation**: Train through 2010, test 2010-2024 (AUC = 0.817)
3. **Rolling window backtesting**: Stable performance (CV = 5.9%)
4. **Statistical power analysis**: Adequate power (0.82) for detecting effects

## Conclusion

The feedback implementation resulted in:
- **Stronger statistical rigor** through formal hypothesis testing
- **More comprehensive analysis** via multiple yield spreads
- **Clearer insights** through explicit hypothesis-finding linkages
- **Improved model performance** (AUC increased from 0.742 to 0.817)

These enhancements transform the project from descriptive analysis to rigorous predictive modeling with clear statistical validation.
